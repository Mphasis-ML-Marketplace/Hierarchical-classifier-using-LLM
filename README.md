# Hierarchical Classifier using LLMs

## Product Overview
The idea is to take a textual data as input (such as a IT incident tickets, customer helpdesk queries, or documents/emails) and predict the appropriate category at each level of a hierarchy. This system is useful when dealing with data that has multiple levels of granularity, and it's crucial for organizing information based on more specific or broad categories. This trainable listing fine-tunes Phi-3 model, and the resulting LoRA adapters can be directly used for inference. Users must provide datasets with textual descriptions of any specific domain and their corresponding multi-level labels, ensuring the label count does not surpass 256.

## Product Highlight
 * This solution streamlines classification workflows by automatically mapping textual input to the most relevant hierarchical categories, reducing manual tagging efforts and accelerating decision-making processes across diverse industries.
 * Using lora adapters, our solution enables efficient fine-tuning of Phi-3 model while minimizing computational overhead. The resulting trainable LoRA adapters can be seamlessly applied in multi-adapter settings, providing flexibility for deployment across various use cases. 
 * Mphasis DeepInsights is a cloud-based cognitive computing platform that offers data extraction & predictive analytics capabilities. Need customized Machine Learning and Deep Learning solutions? Get in touch!
